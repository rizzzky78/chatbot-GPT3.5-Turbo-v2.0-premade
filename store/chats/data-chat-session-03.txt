In today's digital era, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are required to adapt to changes in technology and utilize them for their advantage to stay competitive. The emergence of various digital platforms has revolutionized business processes, including sales, marketing, and customer service. One of the most commonly used digital platforms is the instant messaging application, WhatsApp, which has become a significant communication tool for businesses to connect with their customers.

UMKM Stokis Center Sidanegara Cilacap is one such SME that operates as a distributor and reseller of herbal products from PT Herba Penawar Alwahida Indonesia (HPAI). As a Halal Business Network company, HPAI focuses on providing high-quality and halal consumer goods in Indonesia. HPAI officially established on March 19, 2012, offers various products ranging from herbal medicine to beauty and personal care products.

As a distributor of HPAI products, UMKM Stokis Center Sidanegara Cilacap's admin faces several challenges in managing customer inquiries, order processing, and delivery. The admin handles all customer inquiries and purchases through WhatsApp, the main and most accessible communication channel used by the business. While the WhatsApp communication channel has proven to be efficient, the admin at times finds it challenging to manage multiple customer inquiries simultaneously, which leads to delayed responses and unsatisfactory customer experience.

To mitigate the challenge of managing multiple customer inquiries simultaneously and reduce the response time, UMKM Stokis Center Sidanegara Cilacap has decided to employ a chatbot on the WhatsApp platform. The chatbot, designed using TypeScript and JavaScript programming languages, leverages the Baileys WhatsApp Application Programming Interface (API) library to ensure efficient, scalable, and secure communication.

The chatbot will serve as a virtual assistant for customer inquiries related to product and service information. Customers seeking additional information on HPAI products and services or placing orders can message the chatbot, which will promptly respond to their queries. It is important to note that payment processing and delivery will still be handled by the admin; the chatbot will only assist with product and service information.

The implementation of chatbot technology will significantly benefit UMKM Stokis Center Sidanegara Cilacap. The chatbot's automation of inquiry handling will ensure efficient, fast, and personalized interactions with customers that will improve customer satisfaction and boost business growth.

The use of chatbots in business has become increasingly popular in recent years due to their cost-effectiveness and ability to help businesses automate customer communications, increase efficiency, and improve customer experiences. According to Gartner, by 2022, over 70% of customer interactions will involve emerging technologies such as chatbots. This highlights the increasing importance of chatbots in the business world and further emphasizes the significance of this research.

In conclusion, the implementation of chatbot technology on the WhatsApp platform holds significant promise for UMKM Stokis Center Sidanegara Cilacap to overcome its current customer inquiry management challenges. This research aims to optimize UMKM Stokis Center Sidanegara Cilacap's online business processes using chatbot technology to enhance customer engagement and provide a superior customer experience.
